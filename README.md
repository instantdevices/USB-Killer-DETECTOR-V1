    <strong>USB KILLER DETECTOR</strong>
</p>
<p>
UBS Kill is a pen-testing device that looks like a regular USB flash drive. When these USB flash drives are connected into a USB port of your personal computer, then the 5V found in the USB port is converted into about 220 Volts. Needless to say that the computer can be physically damaged in seconds, resulting in the spending of money and resources to replace broken parts.
