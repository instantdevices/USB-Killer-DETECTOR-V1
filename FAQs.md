    <strong>USB KILLER DETECTOR</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1) What is the use of this device?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Device detects a USB Kill, which is a USB flash drive that converts the low
    voltage in a USB port into about 220 Volts, causing damage to hardware when
    connected into a USB port. Device works as a security layer to protect your
    computer/phones or any other device that has a USB port.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2) Does this device require batteries?</strong>

    <strong>3) Can I recharge batteries using device?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Of course!
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        4) Will a regular USB flash drive be damaged if connected to device?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    No, regular USB flash drives are not damaged. USB Kill will still be
    functional after detection.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        5) Can this device be used as a middle point between USB flash drive
        and computer / phone?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    No, device will only show if USB flash drive inserted is a USB Kill. Data
    transference is not possible in any of these versions yet.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        6) How do I know if device is on, charging or if USB flash drive will
        damage my computer / phone?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Version 1:
</p>
<p>
    - Charging = yellow light turns on.
</p>
<p>
    - On (ready to detect) = green light.
</p>
<p>
    - USB Kill detected = red light turns on.
</p>
<p>
    Version 2:
</p>
<p>
    - Ready to detect = yellow light turns on.
</p>
<p>
    - USB Kill detected = red light turns on.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>7) How long does a battery charge last?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This depends on the use. Regularly, a fully charged battery can last
    several days.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>8) How should I use this device?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Insert USB flash drive into USB port and press switch. Repeat this step at
    least 2 times. Keep an eye on the red light for results because if red
    light turns on means that USB flash drive is a USB Kill.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        9) Is there a limit in the number of times I can detect a USB Kill?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Battery charge is the limitation on version 1. A charge cable with
    electricity is the limitation on version 2.
</p>
<p>
    10) Does this device have a case?
</p>
<p>
    There are three different cases available for version 1.
</p>
<p>
    - Case 1: Internal Flat Battery (non-removable). A Nomex Sheet between
    battery and PCB is recommended.
</p>
<p>
    - Case 2: External Flat Battery (removable). This cable is recommended:

</p>
<p>
    There is one case for version 2.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        10) What company and configuration do you recommend for 3D printing
        cases?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We recommend using Sculpteo:
</p>
<p>
    - SLS (Plastic)
</p>
