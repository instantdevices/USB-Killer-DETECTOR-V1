<p><strong>3) Can I recharge batteries?</strong></p>
<p><em>Of course!</em></p>
<p><strong>4) Will a regular USB flash drive be damaged if connected to device?</strong></p>
<p><em>No, regular USB flash drives are not damaged. USB Kill will still be functional after detection.</em></p>
<p><strong>5) Can this device be used as a middle point between USB flash drive and computer / phone?</strong></p>
<p><em>No, device will only show if USB flash drive inserted is a USB Kill. Data transference is not possible in any of these versions at this time. It is a future development.</em></p>
<p><strong>6) How do I know if device is on, charging or if USB flash drive will damage my computer / phone?</strong></p>
<p><em>Version 1:
- Charging = yellow light turns on.
- On (ready to detect) = green light.
- USB Kill detected = red light turns on.</em></p>
<p><em>Version 2:
- Ready to detect = yellow light turns on.
- USB Kill detected = red light turns on.</em></p>

<p>7) How long does a battery charge last?</p>
<p><em>This depends on the use. Regularly, a fully charged battery can last several days.</em></p>

<p>8) How should I use this device?</p>
<p><em>Insert USB flash drive into USB port and press switch. Repeat this step at least 2 times. Keep an eye on the red light for results because if red light turns on means that USB flash drive is a USB Kill.</em></p>

<p>9) Is there a limit in the number of times I can detect a USB Kill?</p>
<p><em>Battery charge is the limitation on version 1. A charge cable with electricity is the limitation on version 2.</em></p>

<p>10) Does this device have a case?</p>
<p><em>There are three different cases available for version 1.</em></p>
<p><em>- Case 1: Internal Flat Battery (non-removable). A Nomex Sheet between battery and PCB is recommended.</em></p>
<p><em>- Case 2: External Flat Battery (removable). This cable is recommended: <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1131" rel="nofollow"> https://www.adafruit.com/product/1131 </a></em></p>
<p><em>- Case 3: Two external batteries.</em></p>
<p><em>There is one case for version 2.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11) What company and configuration do you recommend for 3D printing cases?</p>
<p><em>We recommend using Sculpteo:</em></p>
<p><em>- SLS (Plastic)</em></p>
<p><em>- Nylon PA12 100-120&mu; (White)</em></p>
<p><em>- Finish: Dyed Polished, Black</em></p>

<p>12) What charger do you recommend to charge device?</p>
<p><em>Regular micro-USB phone chargers with an output of 5V/1A or also 5V/2A.</em></p>

<p>13) What screws do cases use?</p>
<p><em>Self-tapping M2x6 screws.</em></p>

<p>14) Is there any troubleshooting guide?</p>
<p><em>Yes, there is a troubleshooting guide for PCB assembly and quick testing.</em></p>
