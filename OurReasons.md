    <strong>Our Efforts to Find the Ideal Solution to A Common Problem</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    USB Kill is a pen testing USB flash drive that transforms a USB port’s 5
    Volts into about -220 Volts, leading to the destruction of hardware of, for
    example, a personal computer, laptop or even a phone. However, there is not
    a big deal regarding these flash drives because they have a logo on the
    outside clearly indicating that they are a pen testing device.
</p>
<p>
    Issue comes when these flash drives are being massively manufactured
    without any type of logo on the outside. The result is that it cannot be
    known if your flash drive could cause damage to hardware and, therefore,
    having to replace USB ports, motherboards, hard drives, and even power
    supplies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>My Personal Experience</strong>
</p>
<p>
    My father uses to buy many items online. In fact, there is almost a package
    arriving every two days in a single month. He purchases electronics
    components as he is an electronics technician but he also brings home
    unnecessary products such as excess of nuts, bolts and tools that he
    implements in only a project he might have, and then they are useless. He
    has a room at home where I can barely walk.
</p>
<p>
    Once upon a day, I was looking for a USB flash drive to watch on the TV an
    old movie that was stored in my personal computer. I did not find any
    anywhere, so I went to this room to search for one. I was excited to be
    close to fulfilling my wish of recalling this old movie I watched with my
    grandfathers. I connected this flash drive to the computer, went around the
    table and found out that the computer was off but without ignoring a small
    sound created just after the connection.
</p>
<p>
    “What is going on here!” I asked myself after realizing that my computer
    did not turn on anymore. I checked all cables, electricity and all was
    working as usual, except my computer that did not turn on.
</p>
<p>
    It took a few days of investigation to find out that the cause was a pen
    testing device, in this case a USB flash drive, that did not have any
    indications at all on the outside of what it was. There was not even a
    single warning, label or anything alike.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Speaking of Bad Experiences</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A student of the College of St. Rose used a “USB Killer Device,” which is
    the name these devices are commonly referred to, to destroy 66 computers,
    monitors and computer-enhanced podiums. You can read more in the following

    It did not end well for this student…

        “When he is sentenced on August 12, 2019 by United States District
        Judge Mae A. D’Agostino, [student] faces up to 10 years in prison, a
        fine of up to $250,000, and a term of post-imprisonment supervised
        release of up to 3 years.”

</p>
<p>
    <strong>My Point of View</strong>
</p>
<p>
    After thinking about all this situation, I realized that it was, indeed, a
    problem that these USB Killers did not have labels or warning on them,
    however, it was a bigger problem that people and institutions did not have
    a way to prevent these hardware damage situations or, specifically, a
    practical method to detect and neutralize these flash drives before
    hardware was damaged.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Further Understanding</strong>
</p>
<p>
    “Why are these USBs made this way? Without any type of warnings at all?” I
    asked myself.
</p>
<p>
    Searching the web, I found a possible answer to my question:

    <em>
        “Kill the data from your laptop if the law enforcement has caught your
        laptop.”
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    At least for me, the above quote provides the goal and reason behind
    leaving these USB Killers without any warning, logos or labels at all.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Our Solution</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Together with my father, we hired several electrical engineers, CAD
    specialists and technicians related to the field to find out a solution to
    the problem. Our initial idea was to detect these flash drives, and we
    thought that the final product needed to be about pocket-size and easy to
    carry everywhere.
</p>
<p>
    We called this device USB Killer Detector, and as its name mentions, it
    detects USB Killers before they are connected to a USB port and, therefore,
    avoid damage to hardware. You can find the documentation such as schematics
    and photos at the end of this article.
</p>
<p>
    As you might have noticed, introducing you to our device is the main goal
    with this article, but also, we would like to gain awareness, traction and
    gather around a community that would support and help us create the perfect
    final product for this problem that is happening.
</p>
<p>
    Our current product is not close to perfect and not even close to the final
    product idea, which I share with you in the following lines: My vision for
    the future of this project is that it becomes a hub where multiple flash
    drives can be connected and data can be transferred between these flash
    drives and third-party devices such as computers. Of course, if there is a
    USB Killer connected to this hub, then prevent the damage to hardware.
</p>
<p>
    My father and I have spent several of our resources over the last two year
    developing this project to where it is today and we think that the help of
    people interested would speed up the arrival to the final product.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A Final Word</strong>
</p>
<p>
    “Does it cross your mind that the use of USB Killers is an isolated case?”
    I ask you, dear reader.
</p>
<p>
    The following video has a total of 19 million views over the past five
    years, which means ten thousand views per day during all that time.

<p>
    The above video has 1.6 million views over the last year, which means four
    thousand views per day.

    Finally, to find a third example, have you searched for these USB Killers
    in big online retailers?
