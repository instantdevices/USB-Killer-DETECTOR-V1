    UBS Kill is a pen-testing device that looks like a regular USB flash drive.
    When these USB flash drives are connected into a USB port of, for example,
    your personal computer, then the 5V found in the USB port is converted into
    about 220 Volts. Needless to say, that, in matters of seconds, the computer
    can be physically damaged, resulting in the spending of money and resources
    to replace broken parts.
