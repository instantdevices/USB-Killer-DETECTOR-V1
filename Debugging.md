    Components D1 and D5 should not be hot. However, they can be hot when it
    suppresses a power surge but, without power surge, they should not get hot.
</p>
<p>
    This device has internal diodes only. Please note that one pin is left un
    connected (VBUS pin).
</p>
<p>
    If users incorrectly solder these components (D1 and D5) and that
    particular unwanted pin is connected to power rail mistakenly, then diodes
    should get hot.
</p>
<p>
    Other reason for the abnormal heat is due to soldering.
</p>
<p>
    If user inserted a USB Killer to device and components D1 and D5 got hot,
    then may be these components are already dead by now.
</p>
<p>
    If this is the case, please remove components and continue lecture.

    Next step is checking voltage of the main surge detector IC (NX20P0408).
</p>
<p>
    User should check any GND pin of the circuit with D8 diodeâ€™s pin (USB side
    pin). This should be nearly 5V.
</p>
<p>
    If it is not nearly 5V, user has to check boost converter output voltage.
    It is TP12 and GND (not in above schematic).
</p>
<p>
    Then user needs some small voltage (limited current) source which can feed
    into USB Bus (bench power supply may work if user adjusts the current
    limiter around 300mA-500mA).
</p>
<p>
    Slowly user needs to increase the voltage up to around 28V at USB Data pins
    and check whether the main detector is triggered or not.
</p>
<p>
    To see if main detector is triggered, please check TP4 and +5V line with
    your voltmeter. If a power surge is detected, then voltmeter should show a
    value of around +5V. If this happens, user can conclude that the main
    detector IC is working.
